# gatsby-plugin-typescript

Provides drop-in support for TypeScript and TSX.

## Install

`npm install gatsby-plugin-typescript`

## How to use

1.  Include the plugin in your `gatsby-config.js` file.
1.  Write your components in TSX or TypeScript.
1.  You're good to go.

`gatsby-config.js`

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // ...,
  plugins: [...`gatsby-plugin-typescript`],
}
```

## Caveats

This plugin uses [`babel-plugin-transform-typescript`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-typescript.html)
to transpile typescript. It does _not do type checking_. Also since the TypeScript
compiler is not involved, the following applies:

> Does not support namespaces.
> Workaround: Move to using file exports, or
> migrate to using the module { } syntax instead.
>
> Does not support const enums because those require
> type information to compile. Workaround: Remove the
> const, which makes it available at runtime.
>
> Does not support export = and import =, because those
> cannot be compiled to ES.next. Workaround: Convert
> to using export default and export const,
> and import x, {y} from "z".

## Type checking

First of all you should set up your IDE so that type errors are surfaced.
Visual Studio Code is very good in this regard.

In addition, you can see the instructions in [TypeScript-Babel-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Babel-Starter)
for setting up a `type-check` task.
